Student Record System

Problem Statement: Student Record System
The aim of this project is to develop a Student Record System using the C programming language. The system should provide a platform for managing and storing student records efficiently. The system will allow users, such as teachers or administrators, to perform various operations related to student information, including adding new student records, searching for specific students, displaying student details, and calculating average marks.
The Student Record System should be user-friendly and provide a simple interface for performing these operations. It should allow users to input and store relevant information such as student names, roll numbers, marks obtained in different subjects, and attendance records.
The system should offer the following features:


The Student Record System will provide an efficient way to store and manage student information, making it easier for teachers or administrators to access and track student records.


some example test cases for the Student Record System presented in a table format:


| Test Case Description | Input | Expected Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add new student record | Name: John Doe | New student record added successfully. |
|  | Roll number: 123 |  |
|  | Marks: Math - 85, Science - 92, English - 78 |  |
|  | Attendance: 90% |  |
| Search for an existing student by roll number | Roll number: 123 | Student found: John Doe |
| Search for a non-existing student by roll number | Roll number: 456 | Student not found. |
| Search for an existing student by name | Name: Jane Smith | Student found: Jane Smith |
| Search for a non-existing student by name | Name: Emily Brown | Student not found. |
| Display all student records | - | List of all student records displayed: |
|  |  | 1. John Doe, Roll Number: 123, Marks: Math - 85, Science - 92, English - 78, Attendance: 90% |
|  |  | 2. Jane Smith, Roll Number: 456, Marks: Math - 92, Science - 88, English - 75, Attendance: 95% |
| Calculate average marks for a student | Roll number: 123 | Average marks for John Doe: 85.0 |
| Calculate average marks for another student | Roll number: 456 | Average marks for Jane Smith: 85.0 |These test cases cover various scenarios such as adding new student records, searching for students by roll number and name, displaying all student records, and calculating average marks for specific students. You can use these test cases as a starting point and expand them based on your specific requirements and additional functionalities in the Student Record System.
